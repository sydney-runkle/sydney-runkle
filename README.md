# Hello and Welcome! 🚀

## About Me

- 💻 I work as a software engineer at [@pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic), and I primarily focus on open source.
- 🦡 I'm graduated with my degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2024.
- 🏃‍♀️ When I'm not coding, you can find me running, biking, or doing anything outside!
- 🎧 I'm a podcast addict! I love listening to podcasts on a wide range of topics, including politics, tech, news, philosophy, and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust and typescript, and I'm hoping to be fluent by the end of the year.
- 🥐 Fun fact: I try to bake something new every single week!
