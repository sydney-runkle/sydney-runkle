# Hello and Welcome! 🚀

## About Me

- 🦡 I'm currently finishing up my degree in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
- 💻 I work as a software engineering intern at [@pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic), and once I graduate, I'll transition to full time work.
- 🏃‍♀️ When I'm not coding, you can find me running, biking, or doing anything outside!
- 🎧 I'm a podcast addict! I love listening to podcasts on a wide range of topics, including politics, tech, news, philosophy, and books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust and typescript, and hoping to be fluent by the end of the year.
- 🥐 Fun fact: I try to bake something new every single week!
