# Hello and Welcome! 🚀

## About Me

- 💻 I work as a software engineer at [@langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), and I primarily focus on open source.
- 🦡 I'm graduated with my degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
- 🏃‍♀️ When I'm not coding, you can find me running, biking, or doing anything outside!
- 🎧 I'm a podcast addict! I love listening to podcasts on a wide range of topics, including politics, tech, news, philosophy, and music.
- 🥐 Fun fact: I try to [bake something new](https://medium.com/@sydneymarierunkle/i-bake-every-sunday-why-dont-i-write-too-35c81c9fb2b0) every single week!
